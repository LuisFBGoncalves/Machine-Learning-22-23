## 1 Introduction

A new disease has recently been discovered by Dr. Smith, in England. You have
been brought in to investigate. The disease has already affected more than 5000
people, with no apparent connection between them.

The most common symptoms include fever and tiredness, but some infected peo-
ple are asymptomatic. Regardless, this virus is being associated with post-disease
conditions such as loss of speech, confusion, chest pain and shortness of breath.

The conditions of the transmission of the disease are still unknown and there are no
certainties of what leads a patient to suffer or not from it. Nonetheless, some groups
of people seem more prone to be infected by the parasite than others.

## 2 Objective of the project

In this challenge, your goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question,
“Who are the people more likely to suffer from the Smith Parasite?”. With that
goal, you can access a small quantity of sociodemographic, health, and behavioral
information obtained from the patients.

As data scientists, your team is asked to analyze and transform the data available as
needed and apply different models to answer the defined question in a more accurate
way. Can you build a model that can predict if a patient will suffer, or not, from the
Smith Disease?

The score of your predictions is the percentage of instances you correctly predict,
using the f1 score.


## 3 Datasets

You have access to two different datasets:

1. The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. In this
    set, you also have the ground truth associated to each patient, i.e., if the patient
    has the disease (Disease = 1) or not (Disease = 0). Is composed by:
    traindemo.csv- the training set for demographic data and the target
    trainhealth.csv- the training set for health related data
    trainhabits.csv- the training set for habits related data
2. The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen
    data. In this set you don’t have access to the ground truth, and the goal of
    your team is to predict that value (0 or 1) by using the model you created using
    the training set. Is composed by:
    testdemo.csv- the test set for demographic data
    testhealth.csv- the test set for health related data
    testhabits.csv- the test set for habits related data

The available data contains the following attributes:


Sociodemographic Data

## 4 Deliverables

1. A Jupiter notebook with all the needed code implemented to obtain the results
    presented in the report and to obtain the performance obtained in Kaggle.
    The file naming format should be ”202223FallAAGroupXXNotebook.ipynb”,
    where ”GroupXX” should be your group number.
2. A report that describes the analytical processes and the conclusions obtained,
    with at most 8 pages. The report should be organized as follows:
       - Introduction
       - Exploration
       - Preprocessing
       - Modelling


- Assessment
- Conclusion
- References
- Annexes
The report should respect the following format:
- Heading 1:Arial, Size 12 pt, in bold
- Heading 2 (if needed):Arial, Size 11 pt, in bold and italic
- Text:Arial, Size 10 pt, line space of 1.5 points.
- Margins:The default ones in word (Top, Bottom, Left and Right as 1”).
All the figures and tables should be included in the Annexes (at the
end of the document) and referenced in the body text, and are not
included on those 8 pages mentioned previously.
The 8 pages restriction is limited to the content of the report (do not
include cover, index, references or annexes)
The reports that do not follow the specified conditions will suffer penalization
on the grade.


The file naming format should be ”202223FallAAGroupXXReport.pdf”, where
”GroupXX” should be your group number.

### 4.1 Notes

- We will evaluate all the topics mentioned based on the report - a well-structured
    and succinct report will have a big weight on the evaluation.


- The jupyter notebook will be analyzed only if some doubt arises during the
    report evaluation. If some steps were done in the Jupyter notebook but not
    described in the report, we will not evaluate those. As an example, imagine
    you check the outliers, and at the end of your project, you decide to keep them.
    In the report, you should mention how you check if you had outliers, what the
    steps were to remove them and why you decide to keep them at the end, among
    other insights that can be relevant. The jupyter notebook should be delivered
    with all the cells already run.
- The report and the code will pass through a process of plagiarism checking.
- The report should clearly refer (on a cover or on the first page if no cover is
    included) the group number, the students’ names and the students’ numbers.
- For more information, please read the Kaggle competition rules care-
    fully.
- The deadline for submission of all documents is set until the end
    of December 23, 2022. Your report (pdf format) and your Jupiter
    notebook (ipynb format) should be submitted in moodle by this date.
    Additionally, the final submission in Kaggle must be selected. One
    submission per group is enough.
    For each day of delay, there will be a discount of 1 value on the final
    grade. The maximum possible number of days of delay is three days
    (with a penalization of 3 values out of 20).


## 5 Evaluation Criteria

The following table quantifies the major evaluation criteria.

Criteria Percentage Maximum Grade
(out of 20)
Kaggle performance 20% 4
Report-quality and Story-telling 15% 3
Exploration 10% 2
Preprocessing 10% 2
Modelling 20% 4
Performance Assessment 10% 2
Other predictive models (not given during classes) 5% 1
Creativity & Other Self-Study 10% 2
TOTAL 100% 20
A project that focus only on the techniques and methodologies approached during
the practical classes will have at most 17 values. The remaining 3 values are possible
to achieve if contributions based on self-study and creativity are applied, and clearly
explained on the report.
This bullet-list provides some details about each aspect:

- Kaggle performace:The performance obtained on Kaggle, on the submission
    selected (F1 Score).
- Report-quality Story-telling: Each report should describe the steps and
    main insights along the process. Clarity, synthesis, objectiveness, and business-
    contextualization are very welcome.Your decisions and steps must be reasonably
    justified by the previous findings (when this is possible and feasible), your hy-
    pothesis and findings must be related to the problem’s business-context, etc.


- Exploration:Describe the studied population using statistical measures, mean-
    ingful insights and visualizations representative of the major insights.
- Preprocessing: Includes all the needed steps to transform the raw data into
    the data prepared to model. Involves all the steps for cleaning, transform and
    reduce the dataset. It also involves the creation of new variables (if any) from
    the original input features and the explanation of those. If new variables are
    created, those should be mentioned and described clearly on a table (to be
    included in the annexes).
- Modelling:the implementation of different predictive algorithms and the pro-
    cess of fine-tuning those models. The application of additional models not given
    during classes are optional and considered as points in ”Other predictive mod-
    els”.
- Performance Assessment: The comparison of different models and their
    performance.
- Other predictive models:A theoretical explanation of the algorithm should
    be provided in the annex (not included in the 8 pages). Involves the depth and
    the quality of the comparative analysis provided by the different algorithms,
    the theoretical explanation of the algorithm itself and the justification of the
    chosen parameters;
- Creativity and Other Self-Study:If other techniques not given during prac-
    tical classes are applied, a theoretical explanation of the algorithm / technique
    should be provided in the annex (not included in the 8 pages). This topic
    includes not only the application of different techniques but also aspects of
    creativity, such as the the quality of visualizations, plots and others.


All topics are evaluated through a comparison of the work provided by the different
groups.
